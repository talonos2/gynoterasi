# Gynoterasi

Adds a monstergirl race called the Gynoterasi. There will be several different gynoterasi variations that represent various monstergirls, each implemented as a seperate xenotype. Adds new genes to support these xenotypes, many of which can also be used by humans. Depends on Humanoid Alien Races and several other mods. Heavy WIP!

This mod is hosted on github mostly so that I can use the github wiki to organize mod documentation and roadmap items.
